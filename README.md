This project is a fantastic opportunity to show employers your collaborative skills and coding abilities, especially in the context of a scalable, user-focused MERN app. Remember that employers want to see what you can do, but they also want to see how you work with other developers. 

The requirements for this project ask you to use the skills and technologies youâ€™ve learned over the past six weeks, including the following:

Performant JavaScript
NoSQL databases
React single-page applications
GraphQL APIs
Concurrent servers in a MERN app
Authentication
